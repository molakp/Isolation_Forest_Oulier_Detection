# Oulier Detection With Isolation Forest

## Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection using the scikit-learn library.

## Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

`pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

## Overview
The Isolation Forest algorithm is a model-based approach to identify anomalies in a dataset. It constructs isolation trees, which are binary trees that partition the data into subsets. The key idea is that anomalies are easier to isolate than normal points, requiring fewer partitions.

The steps performed in this notebook are as follows:

- Import the necessary libraries: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, make_blobs from sklearn.datasets, IsolationForest from sklearn.ensemble, and StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

- Generate synthetic data: We use the make_blobs function from scikit-learn to generate 500 observations with 2 features and 1 cluster center. We also manually add 20 outliers to the dataset.

- Normalize the data: It is good practice to normalize the data before using distance-based algorithms. We use the StandardScaler to standardize the features.

- Implement the Isolation Forest algorithm: We create an instance of the IsolationForest class with 100 trees and set the contamination parameter to 5% to specify the expected proportion of outliers in the data.

- Identify anomalies: We use the predict method to identify anomalies in the dataset. Anomalies are labeled as -1, while normal points are labeled as 1.

- Visualize the results: We create a scatter plot to visualize the data, highlighting the normal points in blue and the anomalies in red.

## Usage
You can run the code in this notebook by executing each cell sequentially. Make sure to have the required libraries installed and imported before running the code.

Feel free to modify the parameters, such as the number of trees, contamination level, and the dataset, to experiment with different scenarios and explore the behavior of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.

For any questions or further information, please refer to the documentation of the scikit-learn library or consult the official scikit-learn website.

Happy anomaly detection!
